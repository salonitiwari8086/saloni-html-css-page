            <p>Dear readers,<br>
                Let's now move to the next problem, that is <span class="bold-text"> ‘Find Element in an array’</span>
                of chapter <span class="bold-text">‘array and functions’</span>. So, reader, if you have already done or
                at least tried the previous question which was about the span of an array, then this one is going to be
                as easy as pie for you. Just continue reading.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Understanding the Problem:</span><br>
                Just like in the previous question, first of all you will get a number n, which indicates the length of
                an array. Then you will get n more inputs corresponding to each index of the array. After that you will
                be given one more input, <b>d</b> as <span class="bold-text">data</span>, for which you have to find, at
                which index of array d is present. And in case d is not present in the array then you need to print
                <b>-1</b>. You may also watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/awuSQW2F0AM"> video </a> for better
                understanding of the question.</p>
            <p>Before you move further, it is advised that you spend enough time to understand the question and give it
                a fair try </p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Moving on:</span><br>
                So first of all you will be writing an input statement for an integer n. This n, which represents length
                of the array will be helpful in defining an array say ‘arr’. Now, you need to run a <span
                    class="bold-text"> for loop on the array</span> with integer i, initialized to 0. Also satisfying
                the condition i < n and with an increment of one to i, in each iteration and inside this for loop you
                    will be taking input for ith element of array arr.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="body-coding">
            <pre>
 int n = scn.nextInt();
 int[] arr = new int[n];
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
 arr[i] = scn.nextInt();
 }
 int d = scn.nextInt();
         </pre>
         </div>
        <div class="body-para">
            <p>Let's assume, the user enters n as 5 in input and an array arr is initialized of length 5. So with the
                help of a for loop, values to each index of the array will be allocated. Let’s say you assigned 1, 2, 8,
                5 and 3 as values to corresponding indices of arr.
            </p>
            <p>

                Moving further, now your aim is to find the index of data in array arr, you need to find min and max
                values of the array. So give it a thought and try to figure out how you can find it.

            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, if you couldn’t find it, don’t feel bad. Let’s look at it together.
                So for finding the index of data, it is required that data is present in the array. To check this, you
                need to apply a loop on the array, and using conditional<span class="bold-text"> ( if(d == arr[i] )
                    )</span>, you can make sure that whether data is present in the array or not. Whenever, <span
                    class="bold-text">( if(d == arr[i] ) )</span> this condition is satisfied, index i will be printed
                and the return statement will restrict the further iterations of the loop and stop the execution.
            </p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="body-coding">
            <pre>
for(int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++){
if(d == arr[i]){
 System.out.println(i);
 return;
 }
}
 System.out.println(-1);
         </pre>
         </div>
        <div class="body-img">

        </div>
        <div class="body-para">
            <p>

                And in case, a value equivalent to data is present more than once in a given array, then the first index
                with value equal to data will be printed.
                Also in case, where value equivalent to data is not present in the array then, after control comes out
                of the for loop, -1 gets printed.
                So reader, if you still face any problem in understanding this part, we advise you to watch [1:47-3:40]
